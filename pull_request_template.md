## TODO before requesting PR review

- [ ] I have updated the ticket status
- [ ] I have updated the documentation || I don't need to write any doc <!-- Delete whichever is applicable and check -->
- [ ] I have tested my code
- [ ] I have reviewed and performed my own PR review <!-- Often we find things ourselves during a first review that we missed during development -->
- [ ] All modifications/additions have corresponding unit tests
- [ ] CI tests are passing <!-- No need to ask before because we'll have to reread and potentially read new code as a reviewer -->
